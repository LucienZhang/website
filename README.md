## Introduction

This is the project for [my website](http://ziliang.red/). It's powered by [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and incorporates the following plugins or libraries: [markdown-it-footnote](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-footnote), [Ant Design Vue](https://www.antdv.com/docs/vue/introduce-cn/), [vuepress-plugin-mathjax](https://github.com/vuepress/vuepress-plugin-mathjax), [pseudocode.js](https://github.com/SaswatPadhi/pseudocode.js), [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), [cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/) (to crawl another webpage to get the latest data), [highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/), [signature_pad](https://github.com/szimek/signature_pad), and [vuepress-plugin-tabs](https://github.com/pskordilakis/vuepress-plugin-tabs).

Moreover, it communicates with my self-hosted [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) server to get the rendered static [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), and use [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) service to provide interactive notebooks with the same content. You can find my Binder Repo [here](https://github.com/LucienZhang/website-binder).
